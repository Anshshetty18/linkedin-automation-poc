## Overview

This project is a **Go-based LinkedIn automation proof-of-concept** designed to showcase:

- Clean, modular architecture
- Browser abstraction and behavior simulation
- Safe automation practices
- State persistence for resumable execution
- Separation of concerns across authentication, search, connection, and messaging

All LinkedIn-specific actions are **mocked intentionally** to avoid unsafe automation,
while still demonstrating how such a system would be structured in production.
